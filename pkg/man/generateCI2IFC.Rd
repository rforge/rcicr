\title{Generates 2IFC classification image}
\usage{
generateCI2IFC(stimuli, responses, baseimage, rdata, saveasjpeg = TRUE,
  filename = "", antiCI = FALSE, scaling = "constant")
}
\arguments{
\item{stimuli}{Vector with stimulus numbers (should be numeric) that were presented in the order of the response vector. Stimulus numbers must match those in file name of the generated stimuli}

\item{responses}{Vector specifying the responses in the same order of the stimuli vector, coded 1 for original stimulus selected and -1 for inverted stimulus selected.}

\item{baseimage}{String specifying which base image was used. Not the file name, but the key used in the list of base images at time of generating the stimuli.}

\item{rdata}{String pointing to .RData file that was created when stimuli were generated. This file contains the contrast parameters of all generated stimuli.}

\item{saveasjpeg}{Boolean stating whether to additionally save the CI as jpeg image}

\item{filename}{Optional string to specify a file name for the jpeg image}

\item{antiCI}{Optional boolean specifying whether antiCI instead of CI should be computed}

\item{scaling}{Optional string specifying scaling method: \code{none}, \code{constant} (default), \code{normalized}, or \code{matched}}
}
\value{
List of pixel matrix of classification noise only, scaled classificatoin noise only, base image only and combined
}
\description{
Generate classification image for 2 images forced choice reverse correlation task.
}
\details{
Will save the classification image as jpeg to a folder, and returns the CI
}
