\title{Determines optimal scaling constant for a list of ci's}
\usage{
autoscale(cis, saveasjpegs = TRUE, targetpath = "./cis")
}
\arguments{
\item{cis}{List of cis, each of which are a list containing the pixel matrices of at least the noise pattern (\code{$ci}) and if the noise patterns need to be written to jpegs, als the base image (\code{$base})}

\item{saveasjpegs}{Boolean, when set to true, the autoscaled noise patterns will be combined with their respective base images and saved as jpegs (using the key of the list as name)}

\item{targetpath}{Optional string specifying path to save jpegs to (default: ./cis)}
}
\value{
List of scaled noise patterns and determind scaling factor
}
